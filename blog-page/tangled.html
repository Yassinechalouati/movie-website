        <h1>Tangled: Surprising Secrets Revealed.</h1>
        <h5>Tangled is a triumph of animation and one of Disney's best films. It's also filled to the brim with some questionable things and alarming moments!</h5>

            <h2>All My Friends Are Heathens</h2>
            <img src="https://i.redd.it/51v71azlwco41.jpg" alt="pub thugs">
            <p>It’s pretty funny that the first friends Rapunzel makes after leaving the tower are a group of ruffians and thugs. But their whole musical number was pretty awesome! And in the end, having these guys as friends ended up saving both Rapunzel and Eugene.
                But we also can’t forget that even though these guys all have that fun roguish charm, they’re also criminals that have harmed people. (The guy with the hook pretty much did everything but blatantly say he ended someone. And let’s not forget the guy with blood in his mustache.) It’s safe to assume that pretty much all of Rapunzel’s new friends are also likely criminals. But it does come in handy to have a bunch of hardened criminals on your side (who are secretly softies at heart).</p>

                <h2>She’s Not As Smart As You’d Think</h2>
                <img src="https://64.media.tumblr.com/0a8607f056ee77374fa76a1b563bdd16/4ec25993ae57d946-ff/s1280x1920/ec353ed40b37543b9fe42f6b9fe41cac3c0b06aa.png" alt="mother gothel">
                <p>Mother Gothel is known for being fairly clever and manipulative. This is a lady who gets by more on her wits, though if you put a knife in her hand, she’s just as dangerous. But with all her smarts, her big goal when it came to staying young forever was a bit shortsighted.

                    Eventually, Rapunzel is going to perish, and then what will Gothel do?
                    
                    Yeah, when she had the flower, everything was fine, but since the powers transferred to a human being, Mother Gothel’s plan to steal the child and raise it as her own was a bit shortsighted. Because eventually, Rapunzel is going to perish, and then what will Gothel do? Her plan to just keep Rapunzel isolated from everyone kind of makes sense, but it doesn’t benefit her ultimately. (Unless Rapunzel turns out to be immortal from the flower. Now that would be an interesting plot twist.)

                <h2>Making This Movie Took Forever</h2>
                <img src="https://www.theglobeandmail.com/resizer/-E1LNGI3Nae46ycLLWe4S6OSVVs=/arc-anglerfish-tgam-prod-tgam/public/666YIGYF5NHIDFXGWDIQVBWIOY" alt="gothel hair tangled">
                <p>Some movies are in development for a pretty long time. Considering what it takes for a movie to get made, it’s a pretty intense process. But did you know how long Tangled was in development for? Well, it’s been in the making for decades.

                    No seriously, Disney had been thinking about doing a movie based on the Rapunzel fairy tale since 1937. It was one of the original movies considered post the Snow White craze. It was ultimately rejected, but it stayed on the back burner for the next few decades. Even when the idea was revisited in the 90s, it still didn’t start full development until 2002. And then the movie was released in 2010. Basically, this movie was a long time coming. But I think we’re all glad for the wait since it’s pretty amazing!

                <h2>This Scene Was Going To Be Much Louder</h2>
                <img src="https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/5994baf49bca9f4c417198b7/master/w_4096,h_2145,c_limit/MCDTANG_EC051_H.JPG" alt="lantern scene">
                <p>
                    The floating lantern scene is probably one of the most iconic scenes in Tangled, if not all of Disney. It’s a gorgeous scene that leaves you sitting there with your jaw open as you take in the sights. If there is a festival anything like what we see in Tangled, I want to go to it. But did you know that the lantern festival was going to be very different?

The movie originally had it that fireworks would go off every year on Rapunzel’s birthday. But then the story artist, John Ripa, came up with the idea to do lanterns instead of fireworks. He pitched the idea to John Lasseter, who loved it, and the rest is history. I’m glad they went with lanterns instead. Fireworks are nice, but there’s just something about millions of lanterns in the sky that’s both awe-inspiring and rather soft. It fits the movie well.

                <h2>This Movie Was Not Cheap</h2>
                <img src="https://thomaskinkade.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/tnglup.jpg" alt="tangled painting">
                <p>You can’t deny that Tangled is an absolutely gorgeous movie. Between the amazingly smooth animation of Rapunzel’s hair (that they had to develop a whole new software for), the breathtaking scenery, and the vibrant colors, this movie is just a treat to look at. And don’t even get me started on the music. Considering it was the first Disney Princess movie to be made in computer 3D, it looks and sounds just spectacular.

                    Well, there’s a reason behind that. Making Tangled cost Disney over $260 million. That makes it one of Disney’s most expensive films, right behind Pirates of the Carribean: At World’s End. Considering Tangled made almost $600 million, I think it was well worth the cost. Sometimes you have to pay the high price in order to make something truly amazing.

                <h2>He Was Going To Look Very Different</h2>
                <img src="https://c4.wallpaperflare.com/wallpaper/156/861/196/movies-tangled-disney-rapunzel-wallpaper-preview.jpg" alt="pascal">
                <p>It’s amazing how a little chameleon can be so expressive without having to say a single word. Pascal is both adorable and sassy as Rapunzel’s companion, and he shows his loyalty to Rapunzel over and over. We couldn’t imagine this movie without our favorite little green chameleon.

                    Can you imagine Pascal as a squirrel?
                    
                    But did you know that Pascal originally wasn’t going to be a chameleon? In fact, he was supposed to be a squirrel in the early plans of the movie. Can you imagine Pascal as a squirrel? What’s even crazier is that when they changed his design to a chameleon, he wasn’t going to be green, but purple instead. Personally, I’m glad Pascal is a chameleon, mostly because Disney hadn’t done a reptile animal sidekick before. But how on earth did he come to be Rapunzel’s pet?
